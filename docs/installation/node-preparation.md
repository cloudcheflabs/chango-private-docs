# Node Preparation

Chango installs onto a fleet of **Rocky Linux 9** hosts (master + node managers). The install playbook ships a `node-prep` ansible role that runs first against every host and applies SELinux + ulimit + sysctl. You do not need to do those steps by hand — they are listed here for reference, and so operators can run the same commands manually on hosts they prepared before they had ansible access.

## What `node-prep` does

| Step | Where it lands | Effective |
|---|---|---|
| SELinux → `disabled` | `/etc/selinux/config` (+ immediate `setenforce 0`) | Permissive now, fully disabled after the next reboot |
| ulimit (nofile / nproc) | `/etc/security/limits.d/chango.conf` | New login sessions / service starts |
| sysctl (mmap / somaxconn / file-max) | `/etc/sysctl.d/99-chango.conf` (+ `sysctl --system`) | Immediate |

The role is idempotent — re-running `install.yml` is safe.

## SSH access

The ansible controller (typically the master host) reaches every node over SSH as a sudoers user (Rocky 9 default `rocky`). The SSH key for the playbook user must be the same across all hosts, and `sudo` must be passwordless.

Verify before installing:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key>.pem rocky@<each-host>   "sudo -n true && echo ok"
```

## SELinux (applied by `node-prep`)

Chango requires SELinux **disabled**. Rocky 9's default `enforcing` mode restricts nginx to bind only the `http_port_t` set (80, 443, 8080) and rejects every other port; chango's per-component nginx bands live well outside that range, and the SELinux policy interferes with the JVM components' RocksDB + mmap usage as well.

`node-prep` runs the equivalent of:

```bash
sudo setenforce 0                                                                # Permissive now
sudo sed -i 's/^SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/' /etc/selinux/config         # persist across reboots
```

`setenforce 0` takes effect immediately, which is enough to get chango installed and running. The `SELINUX=disabled` line in `/etc/selinux/config` makes it permanent — you should reboot the host at the next convenient maintenance window so the kernel reloads in disabled mode.

## ulimit (applied by `node-prep`)

JVM components (Trino, Spark, Flink, ZooKeeper, NeoRunBase, kiok, …) open many file descriptors and threads. `node-prep` writes a single drop-in:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/security/limits.d/chango.conf > /dev/null <<'EOF'
*  soft  nofile  131072
*  hard  nofile  131072
*  soft  nproc   128000
*  hard  nproc   128000
EOF
```

The values match Trino's recommended limits (it is the largest single consumer in the bundle). The wildcard (`*`) covers every per-component system user chango creates (`chango`, `trino`, `spark`, `flink`, `postgres`, …).

## Kernel sysctl (applied by `node-prep`)

`node-prep` writes a single drop-in and runs `sysctl --system`:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-chango.conf > /dev/null <<'EOF'
vm.max_map_count = 262144
net.core.somaxconn = 4096
fs.file-max = 2000000
EOF
sudo sysctl --system
```

- `vm.max_map_count` — RocksDB / Iceberg use mmap heavily.
- `net.core.somaxconn` — nginx + Trino HTTP backlog.
- `fs.file-max` — system-wide FD ceiling for many JVMs on one host.

## Disk layout

Chango defaults its data path to `/opt`:

| Path | Used by |
|---|---|
| `/opt/chango` | Chango master/NM install dir |
| `/opt/components/<instanceId>` | Each managed component instance |
| `<install_dir>/data` | RocksDB stores on the master — `master/kms`, `master/iam`, `metadata` |
| `/var/lib/chango` | Bundled ZooKeeper's data dir |
| `/var/log/chango` | Chango master + NM log files |

Mount a dedicated data volume at `/opt`:

```bash
# Example for an AWS EBS volume attached as /dev/xvdb
sudo mkfs.xfs -f /dev/xvdb
sudo mount /dev/xvdb /opt
echo "UUID=$(sudo blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/xvdb)  /opt  xfs  defaults,nofail  0 2" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

If `/opt` already has content (a previously installed JDK, for example), copy it across the new mount first:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/xvdb /mnt/newopt
sudo rsync -a /opt/ /mnt/newopt/
sudo umount /mnt/newopt
sudo mount /dev/xvdb /opt
```

## hostnames

Chango supports two hostname models:

- **Real FQDNs already in DNS** (AWS Private DNS, your corporate DNS, …) — chango registers the OS canonical hostname (`hostname -f`) as the node's FQHN and **does not** rewrite `/etc/hosts`. Component-to-component connections use those FQDNs directly.
- **Short hostnames only** — chango synthesizes `<short>.<chango.cluster.domain>` (default `chango.private`) for every node and keeps a managed block in `/etc/hosts` on every host in sync with cluster membership.

Either model works; nothing to configure beforehand. See [Hosts Sync](../features/hosts-sync.md) for details.

## Verifying prep

Quick sanity check before running the playbook:

```bash
# On every host
getenforce                       # → Permissive or Disabled
ulimit -n                         # → 131072
ulimit -u                         # → 128000
sysctl vm.max_map_count           # → 262144
df -h /opt                        # → dedicated volume mounted
```

Once every host clears these, pick your install path — [Manual Install](manual.md) for a step-by-step shell-driven bring-up, or [Automated Install (Ansible)](automated.md) for a multi-host repeatable install.
