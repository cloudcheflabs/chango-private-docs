# Installation Overview

Chango ships as a tarball and supports three install paths:

| Path | Use when | What you run |
|---|---|---|
| [Manual install](manual.md) | Single-host evaluation, a controlled bring-up where you want to see every step, or an air-gapped host you cannot reach with ansible. | Shell commands directly on each host. |
| [Automated install with ansible](automated.md) | Production. Multi-host clusters. Repeatable bring-up and host scale-out. | `ansible-playbook install.yml` from a controller (typically the future master host). |

Both paths produce the **same** end state on real hosts — masters on the hosts in `chango_masters` (default: 2 for HA), a bundled ZooKeeper quorum on the hosts in `chango_zookeepers` (default: 3 for write-availability), a node manager on every host that runs component workloads, no systemd units, the cluster master key held only in the operator's secret manager and in the JVM process environment.

## Shared prerequisites

Whichever path you take, every chango host is **Rocky Linux 9.x** with:

- SELinux disabled (or Permissive)
- raised ulimit / sysctl (file descriptors, mmap count, somaxconn)
- a dedicated `/opt` mount
- passwordless SSH between hosts (only needed for the automated path)

See [Node Preparation](node-preparation.md) for the exact values. The automated path applies these for you via the `node-prep` ansible role; the manual path means you run them yourself.

## After install

Whichever path you chose, day-2 operations (stop, restart, add hosts) are described in [Cluster Operations](../operations/cluster-operations.md). Stop / restart is always a manual shell action. Host scale-out (add master, add node manager) uses ansible on the automated path and has a manual equivalent for the manual path.

Once the cluster is up, walk through [Getting Started](getting-started.md) to install your first managed component.
