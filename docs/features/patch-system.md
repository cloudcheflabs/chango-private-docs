# Patch System

Chango ships an air-gapped patch system for swapping a component's JAR files and / or its admin-UI bundle on a running cluster without going through the full install / configure cycle. Patches are jar / UI **only** — they never touch operator-edited configuration (`conf/*`), per-instance install metadata, RocksDB state, or component data. The control plane treats a patch as an immutable, signed-by-sha256 artifact that flows from `chango-pack patch` on the build host, through the operator's browser (upload), into the chango master's patch library, and out to every host that runs an instance of the target component.

## What problem it solves

A managed component (Ontul, kiok, ShannonStore, …) has a hotfix you want to deploy across the fleet:

- Without the patch system, the operator either re-runs the full ansible install (overwrites configuration, restages tarballs) or hand-edits `lib/*.jar` on every host (no audit, no rollback, easy to skew across hosts).
- With the patch system, the operator builds a tarball once with `chango-pack patch`, uploads it once to the admin UI, and clicks **Apply** — the leader fans out per-host swap + restart with automatic backup and one-click rollback.

## Component coverage

Patch v1 supports the first-party components:

| Component | Type |
|---|---|
| Ontul          | `jar`, `ui`, `both` |
| kiok           | `jar`, `ui`, `both` |
| ItdaStream     | `jar`, `ui`, `both` |
| ShannonStore   | `jar`, `ui`, `both` |
| NeoRunBase     | `jar`, `ui`, `both` |
| Mium           | `jar`, `ui`, `both` |

Patch v2 (only on `branch-3.0.0` of chango itself) additionally supports patching chango itself — the chango master JARs and the chango admin UI bundle. See the [Chango self-patch (v2)](#chango-self-patch-v2) section below.

A patch built for any other component (open-source engines — Trino, Spark, Flink, Kafka, Postgres, Polaris, Trino Gateway, UI Proxy, Schema Registry) is rejected at upload time. Upgrade those via [Blue / Green Upgrade](../operations/upgrade.md) — chango does not own their lifecycle the way it does the first-party stack.

## Building a patch — `chango-pack patch`

`chango-pack` is the air-gapped tooling shipped inside the chango release tarball. The `patch` sub-command builds the upload-ready tarball from a directory of jars and / or a directory of admin-UI dist files:

```bash
# Java-only patch
/opt/chango/bin/chango-pack patch \
    --component ontul \
    --version   3.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
    --type      jar \
    --jars      /path/to/ontul/lib \
    --out       dist/ontul-patch-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.tgz

# admin-UI-only hot patch (no restart needed)
/opt/chango/bin/chango-pack patch \
    --component kiok \
    --version   3.0.0 \
    --type      ui \
    --admin-ui  /path/to/kiok/admin-ui/dist \
    --notes     "fix DAG status colors" \
    --out       dist/kiok-patch-3.0.0-ui.tgz

# combined jar + UI
/opt/chango/bin/chango-pack patch \
    --component shannonstore \
    --version   3.0.0 \
    --type      both \
    --jars      /path/to/shannonstore/lib \
    --admin-ui  /path/to/shannonstore/admin-ui/dist \
    --out       dist/shannonstore-patch-3.0.0.tgz
```

The output is a `tgz` whose layout is **strictly**:

```
manifest.json              ← {component, version, type, files[].sha256, builtAt, builtBy, ...}
lib/*.jar                  ← required when --type is jar or both
admin-ui/dist/**           ← required when --type is ui  or both
```

Any other top-level entry, or any path outside this whitelist, is rejected at upload time. No `conf/`, no scripts, no full install tree.

The tooling only needs `tar`, `sha256sum`, `find`, and a POSIX shell — it ships inside `/opt/chango/bin/` so the same chango release can rebuild patches in-place on the build host.

## REST surface

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /admin/api/patch/upload` | Raw tarball (`Content-Type: application/gzip`) → leader validates whitelist + sha256, stores under `data/master/patches/`. |
| `GET  /admin/api/patch/library` | Lists every uploaded patch. Optional `?component=ontul` filter. |
| `GET  /admin/api/patch/<patchId>/raw` | Authenticated download of the original tarball (used by node managers when the master orchestrates an apply). |
| `POST /admin/api/patch/<patchId>/apply` | Body `{clusterId, restartMode: "rolling"|"parallel"}` — fans out per-host swap + restart. |
| `POST /admin/api/patch/rollback` | Body `{component, clusterId, to: "lastBackup"|patchId}` — restores `lib/` and `admin-ui/` from `.bak/`. |
| `GET  /admin/api/patch/history?component=&clusterId=` | Per-cluster applied-patch history (read-only fan-out to each NM's `.bak/*` dirs). |

All mutating routes are admin-only (Stage-1 RBAC) and leader-only. Followers transparently forward to the leader.

### Upload

```bash
TOK=$(curl -s $BASE/admin/api/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"<pw>"}' | jq -r .accessToken)

curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/gzip' \
     --data-binary @dist/ontul-patch-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.tgz \
     $BASE/admin/api/patch/upload
```

Response:

```json
{
  "patchId":   "ontul-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-20260530-1f3a",
  "component": "ontul",
  "version":   "3.0.0-SNAPSHOT",
  "type":      "jar",
  "size":      18234567,
  "sha256":    "…",
  "uploadedAt":"2026-05-30T12:34:56Z"
}
```

### Apply

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"clusterId":"ontul-main","restartMode":"rolling"}' \
     $BASE/admin/api/patch/ontul-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-20260530-1f3a/apply
```

The leader resolves `(component, clusterId)` to the set of NMs that host an instance, then sends each NM a `PATCH_APPLY` (`OpCode 235`) carrying the manifest + a master-side `/raw` download URL + the explicit `instanceIds` to swap on that host (the NM has no `clusterId`/role context of its own). The NM:

1. **Downloads** the tarball from the master via the authenticated `/raw` route.
2. **Backs up** the current `lib/` (and `admin-ui/dist/` if `type == ui|both`) of every targeted instance into `<install-dir>/.bak/<patchId>/` — unconditional, every apply.
3. **Overlays** the patch contents on top of the live install dir — `lib/*.jar` replaces matching jars, `admin-ui/dist/**` overlays the bundle. No file outside the whitelist is touched.
4. **Restarts** the instance with the component's existing `bin/stop-*.sh` + `bin/start-*.sh` (only when `type == jar|both` — a UI-only patch needs no restart). `JAVA_HOME` and the original `-Dchango.*` system properties are preserved from the live pid's `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`.

`restartMode: "rolling"` does this one host at a time and waits for the instance to report RUNNING again before moving on; `parallel` fires every host together — faster, but expects all instances to tolerate a simultaneous restart.

The response aggregates per-host results:

```json
{
  "patchId":   "ontul-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-20260530-1f3a",
  "clusterId": "ontul-main",
  "status":    "applied",
  "hosts": [
    {"nodeId":"nm-host1-…", "instanceIds":["ontul-main-master"],  "status":"applied"},
    {"nodeId":"nm-host2-…", "instanceIds":["ontul-main-worker-1"],"status":"applied"},
    {"nodeId":"nm-host3-…", "instanceIds":["ontul-main-worker-2"],"status":"applied"}
  ]
}
```

### Rollback

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"component":"ontul","clusterId":"ontul-main","to":"lastBackup"}' \
     $BASE/admin/api/patch/rollback
```

Rollback is the inverse of apply: each NM restores `lib/` and `admin-ui/dist/` from the requested `.bak/<patchId>/` directory and restarts the instance. `to: "lastBackup"` rolls back to the most recent apply; `to: "<patchId>"` rolls back to a specific past patch. Rollback also writes a fresh `.bak/<rollbackId>/` so a re-roll-forward stays possible.

Because `.bak/` lives **inside the instance install dir**, rollback only sees patches that were applied to that host — not the master's global library. If you wiped `/opt/components/<instanceId>/.bak/` by hand, the corresponding rollback target is gone.

### History

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" \
     "$BASE/admin/api/patch/history?component=ontul&clusterId=ontul-main" | jq .
```

Returns the list of patches whose `.bak/` is still present on the cluster — applied in newest-first order, one row per `(patchId, host)`. The admin UI uses this to drive the PatchHistoryCard on each component page.

## On-disk layout

```
<install_dir>/data/master/patches/
    <patchId>.tgz                ← the raw uploaded tarball
    <patchId>.json               ← parsed manifest + sha256

/opt/components/<instanceId>/
    lib/                         ← live jars  (overlaid by patch apply)
    admin-ui/dist/               ← live UI    (overlaid by patch apply)
    .bak/
        <patchId>/
            lib.tgz              ← pre-apply backup
            admin-ui.tgz         ← pre-apply backup (when applicable)
            manifest.json        ← copy of the applied manifest
```

The leader keeps the master library; each NM keeps the per-instance backups. Two different chango clusters never share a `.bak/`.

## Non-leader catch-up (PR 5)

Followers and node managers must not call out to the leader's HTTP API on every PATCH_APPLY — that would couple every NM's apply path to the leader's admin port. Instead, the patch library is treated like any other chango cluster state: replicated lazily over the internal NIO protocol.

- **OpCode `PATCH_INDEX_REQ` / `PATCH_INDEX_RES`** — leader returns a JSON array of every patchId + sha256 currently in its library.
- **OpCode `PATCH_FETCH_REQ` / `PATCH_FETCH_RES`** — body is the patchId as UTF-8; leader streams the tarball back.

A non-leader master runs `PeriodicLeaderPull` every 30 s: pull the index, compare with the local `patches/` dir, fetch any missing tarballs. The same pull runs immediately when this master **loses** leadership so a brand-new follower never serves a stale library.

This is also what makes the patch system survive a backup / restore: when a fresh chango cluster restores from a backup tarball, the leader's `data/master/patches/` directory is included (see below), and every newly-elected follower pulls from it on startup.

## Backup inclusion

`BackupService.packTarball` includes `data/master/patches/` in the cluster-state backup whenever the directory exists. The manifest reflects this:

```json
{
  "backupId":       "20260530-…",
  "patchesDir":     "/opt/chango/data/master/patches",
  "patchesIncluded": true,
  ...
}
```

Restoring the backup re-populates the patch library on the new master; followers then catch up via PATCH_INDEX / PATCH_FETCH.

## Admin UI

### Settings → Patches

Sidebar → **Settings → Patches** opens the cluster-wide patch console:

- **Upload** — drag-and-drop dropzone. POSTs the raw `.tgz` body to `/admin/api/patch/upload` with the operator's bearer token. On success the new patch shows up at the top of the Library.
- **Library** — every uploaded patch, newest first, grouped by component. Each row shows `version`, `type`, `size`, `sha256` (truncated, click to copy), `uploadedAt`, `notes`, and an **Apply** button that opens the Apply modal.
- **Apply modal** — pick a cluster (autopopulated from the existing instances of the patch's component), pick `rolling` or `parallel`, confirm. The modal streams the leader's response and surfaces per-host status as it lands.

### Patch History card on each component page

Every component's detail page (Ontul, kiok, ShannonStore, NeoRunBase, ItdaStream, Mium) shows a `PatchHistoryCard` in the right-hand panel listing the patches applied to the current cluster — one row per patch with **Rollback** buttons (`lastBackup` or "rollback to this specific patch").

### Non-admin readonly

Non-admin users (members of any group that does **not** hold the `AdministratorAccess` policy) see the Patches page in read-only mode — the Library is visible, but **Upload**, **Apply**, **Rollback** buttons are hidden, and the dropzone is disabled. The backend enforces the same gate.

## Invariants

The patch system is deliberately narrower than "in-place upgrade":

- **Configuration is never touched.** The whitelist excludes `conf/`. Operator-edited properties files survive every apply / rollback.
- **State is never touched.** `data/`, `logs/`, RocksDB stores under the component's install dir are untouched. Iceberg files, Kafka logs, NeoRunBase tables are unaffected.
- **Backups are unconditional.** Every apply writes a fresh `.bak/<patchId>/` before overlaying anything. The operator does not have to opt in.
- **Patches are immutable.** `patchId` is a content-derived id; the same tarball uploaded twice deduplicates.
- **First-party only (v1).** Open-source engines (Trino, Spark, Flink, …) are not patchable through this system; chango itself is patchable only via [v2](#chango-self-patch-v2) on `branch-3.0.0`.

## Chango self-patch (v2)

The patch system is also able to patch **chango itself** — the chango master JARs and the chango admin UI — but only on `branch-3.0.0` of chango (the v2 codepath ships there, not yet on `master`). Conceptually the contract is identical:

```bash
/opt/chango/bin/chango-pack patch \
    --component chango \
    --version   3.0.0 \
    --type      both \
    --jars      /path/to/chango/lib \
    --admin-ui  /path/to/chango/admin-ui/dist \
    --out       dist/chango-patch-3.0.0.tgz
```

What differs is the execution model — chango is patching itself, so it can not be the process that overlays its own running JARs. Apply runs a **3-phase fan-out** through a detached helper:

1. Node managers first.
2. Follower masters next.
3. Leader self last.

On every target host the master forks a `setsid`-detached helper that does `sleep 3 && download && backup .bak/<patchId>/{lib,admin-ui}.tgz && overlay && stop-master.sh / stop-node-manager.sh && start-…sh`. The helper preserves `CHANGO_MASTER_KEY`, `JAVA_HOME`, and the original `-Dchango.*` system properties from the running process's `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`.

Because the leader writes a `master-leader-preferred:<expiresAt>` hint to ZooKeeper just before its graceful stop, the **sticky-leader** mechanism (see [Sticky Leader Election](sticky-leader.md)) reclaims leadership for the same nodeId once the helper finishes the restart — no leadership toggle, no double KMS / IAM init.

Self-patch rollback follows the same 3-phase fan-out but the helper restores `lib/` and `admin-ui/dist/` from the requested `.bak/<patchId>/` before restarting. The rollback branch ships in `branch-3.0.0` only — on `master` the rollback codepath is still v1-only (apply lands without rollback on the chango self side).
