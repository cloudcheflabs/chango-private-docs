As data analytics engineer, you donâ€™t have to struggle with long row Excel to analyze data. SQL is better to analyze data. 
External data like CSV, Excel, JSON can be inserted directly to iceberg table in chango, 
then you can explore and analyze iceberg tables with trino queries.




## Streaming


External event streaming application can insert streaming events into iceberg tables in chango without building streaming platform and writing streaming jobs.


### No Streaming Platform, No Streaming Jobs

If you want to insert streaming events like user behavior events, logs, IoT events to data lakehouses, you need to build event streaming platform like kafka
and write streaming jobs like spark streaming jobs in most cases. But in chango, you don't have to do so.
